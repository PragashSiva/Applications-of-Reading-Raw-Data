# Applications-of-Reading-Raw-Data
This project contains three independent programs that sort/ search and otherwise handle large amounts or raw data:
1. A program that was created to analyze the lighting information of an olympic stadium during a game using jagged arrays
   and output maximum and minimum data. (Requires the raw data file to be run)
2. A program that searches for particular features (words, lack of words, etc.) in a multi-page english word document.
